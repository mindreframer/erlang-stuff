Show a javascript confirm message and on confirmation triggers one or more actions and/or send a postback to the server.

Example::

   {% button action={confirm text="Format hard disk?" action={growl text="Better not"}} %}

Shows a javascript dialog with the question "Format hard disk?".  When this dialog is confirmed then the growl message "Better not" will appear. When the dialog is denied or canceled then nothing happens.
