Adds a tab to the media-upload dialog in the admin which allows the
editor to directly paste an embed code from an external site into a
media item.

When used in the Zotonic site, the `{% media %}` tag then displays the
embed code.

This module is the predecessor to :ref:`mod_oembed` but still can be
used when integrating with services that do not have oEmbed support
but do provide HTML embed-code functionality.
