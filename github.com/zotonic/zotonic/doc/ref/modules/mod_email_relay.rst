Enables the Zotonic site to `relay` emails for the site’s users to
their real email addresses.
             
The user’s email address is `username@hostname`, where the hostname is
the hostname as configured in the :ref:`site’s config file <manual-site-anatomy>`.
Any mails to those addresses get forwarded to
the user’s email address, as configured in the user :term:`resource`.

Any email that has no valid recipient is rejected.
