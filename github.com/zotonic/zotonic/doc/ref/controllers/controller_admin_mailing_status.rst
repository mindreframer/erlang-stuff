This controller shows the mailing status of a :term:`resource`. It
lists each mailing list available in the system, and shows whether or
not the current resource has already been sent to the list.

Per mailinglist, it offers the options to send the resource right now,
or schedule it for later delivery.

There are also buttons for sending the resource to a test mailing list
or to a single email address.
