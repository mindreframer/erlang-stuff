mod_base is the base module, which acts as a container module holding
most of Zotonic basic :ref:`dispatch rules <all-dispatch-mod_base>`,
:ref:`actions` and :ref:`scomps`.

Note that the amount of `templates` has been kept to a minimum in this
module, so that sites are free to implement whatever templates they
want. For a standard site with commonly used templates, see the
:ref:`mod_base_site` module.
