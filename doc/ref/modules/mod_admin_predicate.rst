Add support for editing :ref:`predicates <manual-datamodel-edge-predicates>` in the
admin, by presenting a list of all defined predicates.

Predicates can be added, removed and edited, just like regular
:term:`resources <resource>`, when the user has the permission to do
so. Usually this task is left to the system administrator.

.. todo:: Add more documentation
