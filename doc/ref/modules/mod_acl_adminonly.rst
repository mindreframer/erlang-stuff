The default ACL module for providing access to the admin.

When enabled, each user that is created is allowed access to the admin
interface, with full permissions.

This module is convenient when you just need a simple access model,
usually with a single user who manages the whole site and knows what
he is doing.

For a more finegrained access control, see :ref:`mod_acl_simple_roles`.
