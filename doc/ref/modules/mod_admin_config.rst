Add support for editing the siteâ€™s configuration values, as accessed
through :ref:`model-config`.

The page in the admin is a list of every configuration module, key and
textual value. Entries can be added, removed, and edited, if the user
has the permission to do so.

When a value is large than 65 characters, it will be truncated in the
admin config list view. To view the whole value, click the row.
