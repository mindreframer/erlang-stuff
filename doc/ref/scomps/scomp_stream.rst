Enable WebSockets or Comet communication.

This scomp starts the WebSockets or Comet communication.

When available then a WebSockets connections is opened, otherwise a
long polling Comet connection is started.  The WebSockets connection
will also be used for sending Ajax requests to the server.

Comet connections are not enabled by default to prevent problems with
certain browsers that support only a limited number of open
connections.

Example::

  {% stream %}

This will add javascript to the output of the :ref:`scomp-script`. The
added javascript starts the connection.

For this tag to work, you need to include the main Zotonic Javascript
include, like this::

  {% lib "js/apps/zotonic-1.0.js" %}
  

.. seealso:: :ref:`scomp-script`
